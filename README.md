### TransferMarkt Scraper

First need to pull information for website. DreamTeamTransfers uses real life teams, players, and market values to build out transfer database and that is being pulled from transfermarkt.com.

#### Supported Teams

Though the website solely focuses on the 23/24 summer Premier League Transfer window for the team of your choice, a bigger pool of players are desired. Teams don't just do business within the league but buy and sell players from leagues all over the world. To keep the website in scope, the leagues picked were the most relevant: - Premier League - British Top Tier - Championship - British Second Tier - La Liga - Spanish Top Tier - Bundesliga - German Top Tier - Serie A - Italian Top Tier - Liga Portugal - Portuguese Top Tier - Eredivisie - Dutch Top Tier
